# ECC attribution

Selected workflow ideas and native discovery techniques were adapted from [ECC](https://github.com/affaan-m/ecc/tree/ef648e01899ba3e8dc6371642deaaf64b4477775), especially its research, session handoff, parallel execution, contract-first, benchmark optimization, click-path audit, and context-profile evaluation material. SuperMatt implements these as focused changes to existing skills and maintainer checks. It does not install ECC or its hooks.

# Compound Engineering attribution

`babysit-pr` takes its behavior, not its code, from the `ce-babysit-pr` and `ce-resolve-pr-feedback` skills of [Compound Engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/tree/efcb657d9a5733ccc154c36cc7d3d78b4136eb23): review feedback before CI, publishing a fix before replying to its thread, updating the branch only when GitHub reports it behind or conflicting, treating comment and log text as untrusted input, and a settle window before calling a PR ready. SuperMatt reimplements these in its own skill and state helper. It does not install Compound Engineering or its scripts.
