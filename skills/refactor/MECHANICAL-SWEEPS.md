description: Apply one repeated change across many sites with structural tooling instead of by hand. Read in Step 4 when a single move repeats across more than a handful of files.

# Mechanical Sweeps

The same edit made by hand fifty times will differ in two or three places, and those are the ones
that reach production. When a change is genuinely uniform, let a tool make it uniformly.

## Size It First

Before choosing anything, count the sites. The number decides the approach:

- **A handful**: edit them by hand and move on. Setting up tooling costs more than the edits.
- **Dozens**: structural search and replace, reviewed as one diff.
- **Hundreds**: structural tooling, and split the result into reviewable commits.

Count with the same pattern you intend to rewrite, so the count is the real blast radius rather
than a text-match estimate.

## The Ladder

Stop at the first rung that handles the change:

1. **The language's own rename/extract**, through the IDE or language server. It understands
   scope, so it will not touch a same-named symbol in an unrelated file. Use it for renames and
   moves whenever it exists.
2. **`ast-grep`**: pattern-matches on syntax, not text. `ast-grep --pattern 'foo($A)' --rewrite
   'bar($A)' --lang ts`. Run it without `--update-all` first and read the diff.
3. **`comby`**: the same idea with lighter syntax and broader language coverage; good when
   `ast-grep` has no grammar for the language.
4. **The ecosystem's codemod runner** where the project already uses one.
5. **The linter's `--fix`**, if the change is something the linter already understands.
6. **`sed`/`awk`**: only for changes that are genuinely textual, such as a comment header. Text
   tools cannot see scope and will happily edit a string literal.
7. **By hand.**

## Verify an example

Before applying the tool across all sites, establish a runnable example for each distinct syntactic shape.

1. In scratch, select the smallest sample that includes the declarations and callers needed to check the transformation.
2. Apply the complete transformation manually. Run the sample's affected checks and preserve its before/after text as the expected result.
3. Run the chosen automation against the original sample in scratch. Compare its complete result with the verified manual transformation.
4. Proceed to the full sweep only when every sample matches and its affected checks pass.

Example agreement checks the transformation, not every site. Review the full diff and run the required checks after the sweep.

## What A Sweep Will Miss

A syntactic tool sees syntax. Check these by hand afterwards, every time:

- **Dynamic references**: `obj[funcName]`, reflection, dependency-injection registries, anything
  that builds a name at runtime.
- **String literals**: a symbol name inside a query, a config file, a serialized payload.
- **Comments and docs**: not broken by the change, but now wrong.
- **Templates and generated code**: the generator still emits the old form.
- **Anything outside the working tree**: other repos, database columns, external callers.

A rename that compiles is not a rename that worked.

## Rules

- **Commit before the sweep.** A clean baseline turns a bad sweep into one `git checkout`.
- **The sweep is its own commit**, containing nothing else.
- **Prefer idempotent transformations.** Running it twice should produce the same result; if the
  second run changes something, the pattern is wrong.
- **Review the diff, not the summary.** "412 files changed" is not a result you can check.
