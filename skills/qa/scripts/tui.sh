# Drives a terminal program in a detached tmux session.
#
# start runs COMMAND in a COLS x ROWS session from a launch script, so no
# command line is typed into the pane. Tabs reach the screen as spaces, and the
# pane stays after COMMAND exits, so its last screen and its exit status
# (tmux display -p -t SESSION '#{pane_dead_status}') remain to read. Put the
# environment on COMMAND: env HOME=... PATH=... PROGRAM.
#
# keys sends each KEY through tmux send-keys: text, or a key name such as
# Enter, Escape, BSpace, Up, or C-c. A -l sends the KEY after it as literal
# text, so text that reads as a key name is typed as written. It pauses after
# Escape, so the next key does not reach the program as Alt+key, and it escapes
# a trailing ;, which tmux would read as its command separator.
#
# press sends the keys as keys does, then polls the screen every 0.1 seconds
# and prints it once it stays the same for 0.3 seconds. It exits 1 and prints
# the screen when it still changes after 5 seconds, such as under a clock.
#
# wait polls the screen every 0.1 seconds until it contains TEXT, a fixed
# string, and prints it. It exits 1 and prints the screen once SECONDS (a whole
# number, 10 by default) pass, or once the program has exited without showing
# TEXT. TEXT must fit on one line of the screen, since a narrow pane wraps a
# long message. gone does the same until TEXT is off the screen.
#
# show prints the screen without trailing blank lines, and
# each Nerd Font icon (a private use code point) as [U+XXXX].
#
# resize changes the window to COLS x ROWS, then prints the screen as press
# does, once the program's redraw has settled.
#
# colors prints each run of text that is not blank as ROW COLOR "TEXT", one
# run per line. COLOR is the foreground: #rrggbb, a palette index as c3, or
# default, with +bold on a bold run.
